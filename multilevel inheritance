Suppose we have three classes Vehicle,FourWheeler,and Car.The class Vehicle is the baseclass, the class FourWheeler is derived from it and the class Car is derived from the class FourWheeler. Class Vehicle has a method 'vehicle' that prints 'I am a vehicle', classFourWheeler has a method'fourWheeler' that prints'I have fourwheels',and class Car has amethod'car' that prints'I am a car'.So,as this is a multi-level inheritance;we can have access
to all the other class methods from the object of the class Car.We invoke all the methods from a Car object and print the corresponding outputs of the methods.So, if we invoke the methods in this order,car(),fourWheeler(),and vehicle(),then the output will be
I am a car
I have fourwheels
I am a vehicle
Write a C++ program to demonstrate multilevel inheritance using this.


//mlevel.cpp
 #include<iostream>
 using namespace std;
 classVehicle
 {
 public:
 vehicle()
 {
 cout<<"Iamavehicle\n";
 }
 };
 classFourWheeler:publicVehicle
 {
 public:
 fourWheeler()
 {
 cout<<"Ihavefourwheels\n";
 }
 };
 classCar:publicFourWheeler
 {
 public:
 Car()
 {
 cout<<"Iamacar\n";
 }
 };
 intmain()
 {
 Carobj;
 obj.car();
 obj.fourWheeler();
 obj.vehicle();
 return0;
 }
